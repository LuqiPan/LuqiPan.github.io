***

I really love to try different programming languages, so I decided to add this page to record my path to polyglot.

### Under My Belt:

- Ruby

- CoffeeScript
- HTML
- Haml
- CSS
- Pyret
- Python
- C
- Alloy
- Java
- C\+\+

### Currently Pursuing:

- Clojure (it's a modern Lisp, and I like it. also there's constantly new ideas brought up by Rich Hickey, which is great!)
