###Features:

-   Overlapping subproblems(memoization)
-   Solving small subproblems helps solving bigger subproblems

###3M:

-   Meaning(of each engry) 
-   Method(to fill the table)
-   Meat(How to retrieve the answer)

###Proof:

1. Consider the optimal way to...
2. Consider the last step to that optimal ...

###Order:

The order to fill the table is also related to the architecture of the computer.

###Algorithms:

1. Edit distane
2. Bellman-Ford
3. Floyd-Warshall
