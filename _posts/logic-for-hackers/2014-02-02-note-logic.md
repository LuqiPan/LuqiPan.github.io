###Different styles

1.  predicate calculus style

    can't express reachability properties
2. navigation expression style
3.  relational calculus style

    no quantifiers

###Atom

A primitive entity that is

- indivisible
- immutable
- uninterpreted

###Relation

A structure that relates atoms

- size: number of rows
- arity: number of columns
- set: a table with one column
- scalar: a table with a single entry
- option: a unary relation with at most one tuple
- singleton relation: a relation containing exactly one tuple

###Expressing structure with relations

###Functional and injective

- functional: a binary relation that maps each atom to at most one other atom
- injective: a binary relation that maps at most one atom to each atom
- injection: traditionally means a relation that is both functional and injective

###question

- P41 why not higher-order
