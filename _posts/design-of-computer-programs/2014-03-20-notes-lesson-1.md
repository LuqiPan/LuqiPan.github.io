#####Notes
- Test driven
- Extreme value
- lexigraphic ordering
- use the comparator function, not the item itself
- computing v.s. doing
    - computing: return result, pure functions
    - doing: doesn't return result, inpure functions or subroutines

        It's easy to test pure functions

#####Python features:

- Same function can have different return type(dynamic typing system)
- The use of '--234'.index(r)
- The use of list.count
- list: reversed

#####Refactoring

- DRY: don't repeat yourself

#####Lesson Learned

- understand
- define pieces
- reuse
- test
- explore the design space
    - correctness
    - efficiency
    - elegance
    - features
