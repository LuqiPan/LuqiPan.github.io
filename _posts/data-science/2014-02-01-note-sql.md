###Schema

- Snowflake
- Star

###Relation algebra

- Selection
- Projection
- Cartesian Product

    Join: they are all just syntactic sugar

    - natural join
    - left outer join
    - right outer join
    - full outer join
    - left semi join
    - right semi join
- Rename
- Union
- Minus

###Some gotcha
- The use of 
```
GROUP BY
```

    followed by```having```
- duplicate vs. redundant

###Refs

- Xquery
- Codd's theorom

- SQL does a hell lot of join optimization: simply because join is the most common operation in SQL query
-   sub-query:
    
    - correlated
    - uncorrelated

    normally uncorrelated has a better performance because correlated means do a sub-query for each different value.
- Don't think SQL execution in terms of algorithm sense: because the execution time really depends on the optimization the database does. There may be different indexes for **optimization**.
- SQL tries to get around NULL because normally nobody expects it to throw out some errors. But it brings the consequence that operations involving NULL can have **unexpected** result.
- However, for programming languages, they care more about **correctness**, so basically it will throw exceptions or errors.
- Eg: in WHERE, only output rows whose outcome is TRUE, but reject UNKNOWN/FALSE
