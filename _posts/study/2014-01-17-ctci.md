####Google

Pay attention to Bit Manipulation

####General

Scalability

####Build a strong network

1. Meetup.com or alumni network
2. Be open
3. LinkedIn
4. Be helpful

####Compile a preparation grid

See Page.40

####Power of 2 table

See Page.47

####5 Steps to a technical question

1. Resolve ambiguity
2. Design an algorithm
3. Write pseudocode first(tell about it)
4. Write code at moderate pace
5. Test and fix

####5 Algorithm approaches

1. Examplify
2. Pattern matching
3. Simplify and generalize
4. Base case and build
5. Data structure brainstorm

##Interview Questions

###Data Structures

####1. Arrays and Strings

#####Hash Tables
Implementing a hash table...

#####ArrayList(Dynamically Resizing Array)

#####StringBuffer
Implement your own version of StringBuffer

#####1.1

- Forgot the fact that if the string contains unique chars, then the length should be $$<=$$ length of alphabet
- Need to familiaze with bit manipulation

#####1.3

- For string equal, use String.equals(anotherStr), == only determines if it is identical
- If possible, try to cut out some temporary variables
- If one is permutation of another, they must have the same length
- Always think of some property to minimize the computation
- The pattern to sort an string: toCharArray then sort
- Forget about case sensitive and whitespace

#####1.4

- Watch out about i++ etc
- I really don't know that I'll have the true length of the string(But it says it in the question)**Read!!**
- Starting backwards is really a excellent idea.

#####1.5

- Forget about the last sentence: the addition case
- As long as there is loop, watch out for array out of index!
- An alternative to StringBuffer would be declare the char array with enough space upfront
- Review the countCompression when possible

#####1.6

- It is not neccessary to use recursion
- It's easy to fall into the thinking pattern that every index, position starts with 0
- It's actually matrix transformation

#####1.7

- The thinking is easy
- But think further to reduce the space
- We only care about if one row or column has an zero, we don't care about the exact location

#####1.8

- Abstract the problem!
- Again, length of strings

####2. Linked Lists
