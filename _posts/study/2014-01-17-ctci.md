##Interview Questions

###Data Structures

###1. Arrays and Strings

#####Hash Tables
Implementing a hash table...

#####ArrayList(Dynamically Resizing Array)

#####StringBuffer
Implement your own version of StringBuffer

#####1.1

- Forgot the fact that if the string contains unique chars, then the length should be $$<=$$ length of alphabet
- Need to familiaze with bit manipulation

#####1.3

- For string equal, use String.equals(anotherStr), == only determines if it is identical
- If possible, try to cut out some temporary variables
- If one is permutation of another, they must have the same length
- Always think of some property to minimize the computation
- The pattern to sort an string: toCharArray then sort
- Forget about case sensitive and whitespace

#####1.4

- Watch out about i++ etc
- I really don't know that I'll have the true length of the string(But it says it in the question)**Read!!**
- Starting backwards is really a excellent idea.

#####1.5

- Forget about the last sentence: the addition case
- As long as there is loop, watch out for array out of index!
- An alternative to StringBuffer would be declare the char array with enough space upfront
- Review the countCompression when possible

#####1.6

- It is not neccessary to use recursion
- It's easy to fall into the thinking pattern that every index, position starts with 0
- It's actually matrix transformation

#####1.7

- The thinking is easy
- But think further to reduce the space
- We only care about if one row or column has an zero, we don't care about the exact location

#####1.8

- Abstract the problem!
- Again, length of strings

***

###2. Linked Lists

#####Creating a Linked List

First find the tail, then append the node at the end.

#####Deleting a Node

- Watch out if it's a singly linked list or doubly linked list
- In C, C++ you'll also have to care about memory management

#####The "Runner" Technique

Introduce a second pointer, different pointers have different pace of movement.

#####Recursive Problems

Using recursion is a way out, but that means O(n) space.

#####2.1 Remove duplicates

- LinkedListNode
- HashTable is an important thing(constant to add, find)
- Watchout if head is null
- The loop condition: (n != null)
- The code is very subtle

#####2.2 kth to last element

- Edge case!! Care about every parameter
- You never know if n.next is a null pointer or not, So check everytime you access next field

#####2.3 delete node with only access to that node

- Think harder
- Think outside the box, you may not need to actually eliminate the node in the memory, just make the linked list right after "delete"
- If n is the last node, you cannot delete it. Because you cannot make it null. Consider marking the node as dummy.

#####2.4 partition linked list around value x

- Watch out when you return something, it should not be some value instead of null
- Think about the special case where the linked list is un-balanced around x
- Be careful about pointer operations

#####2.5 linked list addition

- The recursive way is very sutle, pay attention
- Think about all the possible state of the function call
- To put code in separate method is a very clean way
- Must do it **again**!

#####2.6 beginning of the loop

- Find collision point is easy: runner
- But find the beginning is another story
- Need to do the math and use the property of loop

#####2.7 palindrome detect

- Only need to detect if the front half is the reverse of the second half
- Reverse order: the help of __stack__!

***

###3. Stacks and Queues

#####3.1 three stacks in one array

- Read the question carefully, seriously
- Maybe use a linked list to store all index of the stacks, take O(n) to initialize but doesn't waste space

#####3.2 stack returns minimum in constant time

- The min changes when you push and pop
- Pay attention to memory optimization

#####3.3 set of stacks

- Need to revisit the FOLLOW-UP

#####3.4 Hanoi using stack
