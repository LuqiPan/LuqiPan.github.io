The final turned out to be OK though at some point I really didn't think that I can get it through.

I started VM in Weenix pretty late. When I look back, it turns out that I only had 18 days to finish it up. It still has some bugs and I have no idea how to pinpoint them. But I'm still happy that I can finally get it done in such a tight schedule. I have never been totally on schedule, and I really know that driven by deadline can be a terrible process management and a lot pressure on me. It's just who I am that keeps me doing this.

Relating this to some speech I just saw, maybe I should just simply try to do more things in the same time schedule. You'll just find a way to utilize your potential and get it done.
