***

I’m a Master candidate in CS @ Brown. And there’s tons of fun studying here.

Several days ago, Professor Franco gave us a farewell lecture revisiting half a century of Computer Science. It’s really thrilled to be in part of it, and I’m still so young!

Currently I don’t really have a concentration. And I hope to keep it that way. Algorithm, Programming Languages, Operating Systems… I just dive in whatever I’m interested in!

I really admire all those ingenious solutions to sophisticated problems, and what’s more, I admire the ingenuity that envisions which problems are worth solving. That’s what I’m working towards.
